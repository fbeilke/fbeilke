# About Me

I am a full-stack software engineer.

My pronouns are they/them/theirs

I started my career in retail with the most recent position being customer service over the phone with Best Buy.

Diagnosed as Autistic.

When I started to dive into my curiosity for coding, I decided to attend the App Academy software development bootcamp, during which I built three full-stack applications using JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, Express, and more.

My favorite thing about coding is when I get absorbed in problem solving so deeply and everything else disappears. It's like solving puzzles or playing a game for me.

I am also interested in D&D and Critical Role specifically, reading tarot, tattoos, board/card/dice games, and pretty much anything Halloween or spooky.
